# Dylan Girard - Simon Says

## Project Description

My app is a working rendition of the classic memory game, Simon Says. In this game, the player watches a short series of colorful, highlighted buttons light up in a particular pattern. After the pattern has finished, the player must push the buttons in the order in which they were highlighted. If the player is able to match the initial sequence, the round advances and a new, longer pattern of button highlights will display. The game ends when the player makes a mistake, but they may also restart at any time!

## User Stories

**MVP Goals**

- As a player, I want to know how to start the game so that I can be ready to remember the different color combinations as they play out.
- As a player, I want to have a clear indication of which colors are being presented to me so that it's easy to remember the combination in each round.
- As a player, I want to know which round I'm on so I can prepare mentally for the next round.
- As a player, I want a strong visual indication of which buttons I have pressed and whether I matched the computer choices each round. This will make me feel good when I get it right and advance to the next round.
- As a player, I want to be able to restart the game at Round 1 if I don't match the correct combination, or if I just feel like starting over.
- As a player who requires assistive technologies to play, I want to be able to see enough color contrast in the button indicators so that I can clearly tell which buttons to push.

**Stretch Goals**

- As a player, I would like to see a modal when the page loads, explaining the rules of the game if I've never played before.
- As a player, I would like to hear audible sounds for each color-button for more immersion.
- As a player, I would like to be able to store my own button/sound combinations and play them back for a friend.
- As a player, I would like this game to feel very smooth and have high production value (stellar UI design).
